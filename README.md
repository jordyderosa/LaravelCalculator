## Calculator Test
My solution use an interface IOperations implemeted by operation classes as Addiction, Subtraction, etc. and the Calculator class use that interface to create object injecting dependecy. In this way it will be very easy to add new operation in our calculator and to manage them all.

## USAGE
To use this project you have just to download it into your system and then launch the command 
```
composer install
```
inside the project directory.

Now you are ready to use it going to ServerHostname/ProjectDirectory/calculator

That's all
